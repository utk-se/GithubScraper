/**
 * This class is an implementation of {@link PortSupplier} that provides port information for Transport, based on
 * an environment variable.<br>
 * Note: The environment variable must be available on all machines in the cluster, and contain a valid port in range 1
 * to 65535 (inclusive) as an integer value. The environment variable may have different values on different machines,
 * which can be used to set the port to a different value on each worker node.<br>
 * Note that this implementation does not check if a port is actually available - it merely reads and parses
 * the environment variable on the worker, to decide the port to use.
