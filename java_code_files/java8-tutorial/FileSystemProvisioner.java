/**
 * Prepares and provisions workspaces for {@link AbstractProject}s.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. SUBJECT TO CHANGE! DO NOT EXTEND.
 *
 * TODO: is this per {@link Computer}? Per {@link Job}?
 *   â†’ probably per agent.
 *
 * <h2>Design Problems</h2>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Garbage collection of snapshots. When do we discard snapshots?
 * In one use case, it would be convenient to keep the snapshot of the
 * last promoted/successful build. So we need to define a mechanism
 * to veto GC of snapshot? like an interface that Action can implement?
 *
 * Snapshot should be obtained per user's direction. That would be a good
 * moment for the user to specify the retention policy.
 *
 * <li>
 * Configuration mechanism. Should we auto-detect FileSystemProvisioner
 * per OS? (but for example, zfs support would require the root access.)
 * People probably needs to be able to disable this feature, which means
 * one more configuration option. It's especially tricky because
 * during the configuration we don't know the OS type.
 *
 * OTOH special agent type like the ones for network.com grid can
 * hide this.
 * </ol>
 *
 *
 * <h2>Recap</h2>
 *
 * To recap,
 *
 * - when an agent connects, we auto-detect the file system provisioner.
 *   (for example, ZFS FSP would check the agent root user prop
 *   and/or attempt to "pfexec zfs create" and take over.)
 *
 * - the user may configure jobs for snapshot collection, along with
 *   the retention policy.
 *
 * - keep workspace snapshots that correspond to the permalinks
 *   In ZFS, use a user property to remember the build and the job.
 *
 * Can't the 2nd step happen automatically, when someone else depends on
 * the workspace snapshot of the upstream? Yes, by using {@link RunListener}.
 * So this becomes like a special SCM type.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>Design take 2</h2>
 * <p>
 * The first piece of this is the custom {@link SCM}, which inherits the
 * workspace of another job. When this executes, it picks up
 * {@link WorkspaceSnapshot} from the other job and use it to obtain the workspace.
 *
 * <p>
 * Then there's {@link RunListener}, which creates a snapshot if
 * someone else is interested in using a snapshot later.
 *
 * <h3>TODOs</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Garbage collection of workspace snapshots. 
 *
 * </ul>
