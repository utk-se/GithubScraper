 * @author Kohsuke Kawaguchi
 * @since 1.349 - produces search hyperlinks to the http://stacktrace.jenkins-ci.org service
 * @since 2.56 - does nothing due to JENKINS-42861
 * @deprecated This ConsoleNote used to provide hyperlinks to the
 *             <code>http://stacktrace.jenkins-ci.org/</code> service, which is dead now (JENKINS-42861).
 *             This console note does nothing right now.
